## Welcome to Distantmagic üëã üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

Our mission is to provide open-source tools that enable the effective deployment and use of LLMs and ML models in production settings for developers and MLOps/LLMOps. Our key projects include:

1. [**Paddler**](https://github.com/distantmagic/paddler): An open-source load balancer and reverse proxy optimized for servers running [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Paddler ensures efficient request distribution with a stateful load balancer that monitors server slots and health, supporting dynamic scaling.
3. [**LLMOps Handbook**](https://github.com/distantmagic/llmops-handbook): (work in progress) Practical and advanced guide to LLMOps. It provides a solid understanding of large language models‚Äô general concepts, deployment techniques, and software engineering practices.
2. [**Resonance**](https://github.com/distantmagic/resonance): A PHP framework for building IO-intensive web applications and services featuring AI capabilities, a built-in web server, and integration with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). It leverages asynchronous PHP and Swoole. Learn more about Resonance Framework on the [official website](https://resonance.distantmagic.com/).
3. [**Structured**](https://github.com/distantmagic/structured): A tool for extracting structured data from unstructured input, using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). It is programming language agnostic and maps data from arbitrary JSON schemas to Go structs or plain JSON.
